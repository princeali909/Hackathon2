# Helping Hand: HackDavis 2020

## About HackDavis

### Hack for Social Good

With the rapid advancement of technology, it is important to use its power in ways that benefit society. HackDavis challenges its participants to hack for social good, and create an opportunity for us to explore the intersection between technology and society.

On January 18-19, over 700 students, hackers, and creators will come together for 24 hours of hacking. For the 5th year in a row, we're bringing the most talented students in California to address the world’s most pressing issues. Participants are able to build projects that address many social good initiatives.

## About Helping Hand

The app serves as a hiring service for mundane tasks. A user in need of help can create a request and local volunteers are then able to respond. The volunteer is given directions to the user and once finished, the user is expected to make the agreed donation to the charity chosen by the volunteer.

### Inspiration

We wanted to create something that could foster interest in charities. Given the recent popularity of crowdfunding, we wanted to apply a similar idea but for charities. We believe that with many volunteers, especially those who would not donate otherwise, the app can provide an opportunity for people to help each other while also giving back to their communities.

### Built With

- Swift 
- Google Maps 
- Google Directions
- LoginManager

### What's Next for Us

- A real-time rating system to prioritize the most optimal volunteers. 

- An in-app chat system, this way the user can give a detailed explanation of what they require assistance with, give additional directions to their location, etc.

- In-app transactions, to allow the payments to be sent directly to the charity.
